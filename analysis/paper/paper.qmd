# Introduction

The research presented in this paper was prompted by the closure of the European post-Master of Urbanism (EMU) of the Department of Urbanism at the Faculty of Architecture and the Built Environment, TU Delft. The EMU was an advanced master ran jointly by TU Delft, KU Leuven, UPC Barcelona and Universit√† IUAV di Venezia. <!-- Complete paragraph about the program -->

In order to describe the legacy of the EMU program, including the distinctive features of its didactic approach, this paper aims to reveal the main topics taught in it and how those topics had evolved through the years of the program. To that end, we employed a text mining approach in which we analysed its output: `r nrow(all_theses)` theses with an average of `r mean(str_length(emu_theses$text_clean), na.rm = TRUE)` words produced over the years for the duration of the program between `r paste0(min(all_theses$grad_year, na.rm = TRUE), "-", max(all_theses$grad_year, na.rm = TRUE))`. The first year of the program was not represented, as PDF files were only available from 2008 onward.

# Methods

Research questions:

-   What were the main topics addressed in the EMU program?

-   How did those topics evolve throughout the duration of the program between 2007-2021?

-   To what extent were the topics and evolution thereof influenced by the assignments given to the students throughout their studies leading up to their thesis?

-   To what extent were the topics and evolution thereof influenced by the exchange semester followed by the students?

## Data collection

The theses are available in PDF format with complex layouts typical to an urbanism project in which text and various types of graphics are combined.

A total number of `r nrow(emu_theses)` out of `r nrow(theses_all)` were analysed.

```{r}
#| label: fig-map-theses
#| warning: false 
#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: "Location of EMU theses included in the analysis"

# Geocode thesis locations
emu_theses <- emu_theses %>%
  geocode(location, method = 'osm', lat = latitude , long = longitude)

# Show thesis locations on world map
world <- map_data("world")
ggplot() +
  geom_map(
    data = world, map = world,
    aes(long, lat, map_id = region),
    color = "black", fill = "lightgray", size = 0.1
  ) +
  geom_point(data = emu_theses, aes(longitude, latitude), color = "red") +
  coord_fixed() +
  theme_void()
```

Figure @fig-map-theses shows the geographic spread of the theses included in the analysis.

## Data analysis

[@silge2017a] [@hvitfeldt2021a]

### Tokenisation

Word-level tokenisation was applied with the `unnest_tokens()` function of the `tidytext` package. This was preferred over other tokenisers as it produced results that work seamlessly with other `tidyverse` tools.

### Stop words

-   Three types of stop words: global, subject-specific and document stop words.
-   Global stop words:
    -   All theses were written in English, so for common English stop words the "snowball" lexicon was used
    -   Optionally, try creating a custom stop word list on the entire corpus, by removing high-frequency words, starting with 20 words and increasing by 10 until reaching words that are not appropriate as stop words
-   Subject-specific stop words:
    -   Manually constructed list, needs domain knowledge
    -   Words that are commonly used to structure a theses, such as "preface", "contents", and "introduction", were added as custom stop words
-   Document stop words:
    -   Stop words from titles and author names should only be removed from corresponding theses

```{r}
#| label: stop-words

stop_words_custom <- emu_theses %>% 
  unnest_tokens(output = word, input = title) %>%   ### add words from the title
  select(word) %>% 
  rbind(., data.frame(word = c("preface", "foreword", "introduction", "conclusion", "thesis", 
                               "source", "author"))) %>% 
  # rbind(., data.frame(word = c("city", "urban", "urbanism"))) %>% 
  rbind(., data.frame(word = c("hab", "km")))

emu_theses_words <- emu_theses %>%
  mutate(author = paste(first_name, last_name)) %>% 
  select(author, title, text, -c(graduation_year, first_name, last_name)) %>% 
  unnest_tokens(output = word, input = text) %>%   # remove punctuation, convert to lowercase, seperate all words
  anti_join(stop_words, by = "word") %>%  # remove stop words
  anti_join(stop_words_custom, by = "word")
```

Stemming is a pre-processing step that needs to be carefully thought through, as it might either degrade topic modeling or produce no meaningful results [@hvitfeldt2021a].

```{r}
#| label: stemming

emu_theses_words %>% 
  mutate(stem = wordStem(words = word, 
                         language = "porter")) %>%  # Implement the Porter stemming algorithm for English provided by the SnowballC package
  count(stem, sort = TRUE)
```

## Topic model

Similar to topic clustering on numeric data, topic modeling is a method of unsupervised classification of topics found in a group of documents [@silge2017].

# Results

```{r}
# Which are the top n most frequently used words in each thesis?
get_top_words_per_document(data = emu_theses_words, 
                           top_n = 3, 
                           title_col = "title", 
                           word_col = "word")
```

```{r}
# Which are the top n most frequently used words in all theses`?
get_top_words_per_corpus(data = emu_theses_words, 
                         top_n = 5, 
                         word_col = "word")
```

```{r}
# Which theses contain "fabric" in the top 20 most frequently used words?
emu_theses_top_20 %>% 
  filter(word == "fabric")

emu_theses_top_20 %>%
  slice(1:40) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(word, n), y = n, fill = title)) +
  geom_col() +
  xlab(NULL) +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(y = "Count",
       x = "Unique words",
       title = "Count of unique words found in thesis",
       subtitle = "Stop words were removed from the list") +
  facet_wrap( ~ title, scales = "free", ncol = 2)
```
