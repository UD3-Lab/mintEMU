# Introduction

The research presented in this paper was prompted by the closure of the European post-Master of Urbanism (EMU) of the Department of Urbanism at the Faculty of Architecture and the Built Environment, TU Delft. The EMU was an advanced master ran jointly by TU Delft, KU Leuven, UPC Barcelona and Università IUAV di Venezia. <!-- Complete paragraph about the program -->

Distinctive features of the program:  
- as a postmaster, it only accepted applicants with a prior MSc degree and experience in practice
- provides a bridge towards PhD-level research
- all students had an exchange semester at one of the other three program universities

In order to describe the legacy of the EMU program, including the distinctive features of its didactic approach, this paper aims to reveal the main topics taught in it and how those topics had evolved through the years of the program. To that end, we employed a text mining approach in which we analysed its output: `r nrow(all_theses)` theses with an average of `r mean(str_length(emu_theses$text_clean), na.rm = TRUE)` words produced over the years for the duration of the program between `r paste0(min(all_theses$grad_year, na.rm = TRUE), "-", max(all_theses$grad_year, na.rm = TRUE))`. 

# Methods

Research questions:

-   What were the main topics addressed in the EMU program?

-   How did those topics evolve throughout the duration of the program between 2007-2021?

-   To what extent were the topics and evolution thereof influenced by the assignments given to the students throughout their studies leading up to their thesis?

-   To what extent were the topics and evolution thereof influenced by the exchange semester followed by the students?
    - Use LDA clustering with 3 classes (corresponding to the three exchange universities) to see how well the clustering is aligned with where the student carried out their exchange semester. Use a confusion matrix to visualize the relation between real values and values assigned through clustering. 

## Data collection

The theses are available in PDF format with complex layouts typical to an urbanism project in which text and various types of graphics are combined. With the exception of a bilingual English-Spanish thesis, all thesis were written in English.

A total number of `r nrow(emu_theses)` out of `r nrow(all_theses)` were analysed.

```{r fig-map-theses}
#| warning: false 
#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: "Location of EMU theses included in the analysis"

# Add latitude and longitude information to theses data frame
emu_theses <- geocode_thesis_locations(emu_theses)

# Show thesis locations on world map
visualize_thesis_locations(emu_theses)
```

@fig-map-theses shows the geographic spread of the theses included in the analysis.

## Data analysis

### Tokenisation

Word-level tokenisation was applied with the `unnest_tokens()` function of the `tidytext` package. This was preferred over other tokenisers as it produced results that work seamlessly with other `tidyverse` tools used in the analysis.

### Stop words

For analyses in which word-level tokenisation was chosen, stop words, i.e., common words or words that do not add much meaning, were removed in the data preparation stage. Global, subject-specific and document stop words [@hvitfeldt2021a] were differentiated. As all theses were written in English, the pre-made "snowball" lexicon was used to remove global stop words. <!-- We tried to create a custom global stop word list on the entire corpus, by removing high-frequency words, starting with 20 words and increasing by 10 until reaching words that are not appropriate as stop words, but no significant imoprvement was observed in the result. --> Subject-specific stop words, we manually constructed a list based on our domain knowledge. Words that are commonly used to structure a theses, such as "preface", "contents", and "introduction", were added as subject-specific stop words as well. Finally, titles and author names were removed as document stop words on document-level.

```{r stop-words}

emu_theses$text_clean <- emu_theses$text_clean |>
  str_remove_all(find_meta_stopwords(emu_theses)) |> 
  str_remove_all(urbanism_stopwords(
    add_stopwords = c("emu", "european postgraduate master in urbanism"))) |>
  str_remove_all(thesis_stopwords(add_stopwords = c("advisor", "prof")))

emu_theses_words <- emu_theses |> 
  select(title, text_clean) |> 
  unnest_tokens(output = word, input = text_clean) |>   # remove punctuation, convert to lowercase, separate all words
  anti_join(tidytext::stop_words, by = "word")

```

Additional checks were made to the document in search for previously undetected stop words. The checks included identifying words consisting of four or less characters that extensively used in the text corpus. 

```{r}
#| label: short-stop-words

#short_words(emu_theses$text_clean, scope = 'corpus')
short_words(emu_theses_words$word)


```


Stemming is a pre-processing step that needs to be carefully thought through, as it might either degrade topic modeling or produce no meaningful results [@hvitfeldt2021a].

```{r stemming}

emu_theses_words %>% 
  mutate(stem = wordStem(words = word, 
                         language = "porter")) |>  # Implement the Porter stemming algorithm for English provided by the SnowballC package
  count(stem, sort = TRUE)
```

## Topic model

Similar to clustering on numeric data, topic modeling is a method of unsupervised classification of topics found in a group of documents [@silge2017].

```{r}
# The {topicmodels} package requires a document-term matrix as input
emu_theses_dtm <- convert_to_dtm(emu_theses_words, "title", "word")
emu_theses_dtm

# We will use the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm for topic modeling
# In LDA, each document is a mixture of topics and each topic is a mixture of words
emu_theses_lda <- LDA(emu_theses_dtm, k = 2, control = list(seed = 2023))
emu_theses_lda

# Tidy model with beta statistic
emu_theses_topics <- tidy(emu_theses_lda, matrix = "beta")
emu_theses_topics

# The top 10 words that are the most common in each topic
emu_theses_top_terms <- emu_theses_topics |> 
  group_by(topic) |> 
  top_n(20, beta) |> 
  ungroup() |> 
  arrange(topic, -beta)

emu_theses_top_terms |> 
  mutate(term = reorder(term, beta)) |> 
  ggplot(aes(term, beta, fill = factor(topic))) +
  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~ topic, scales = "free") +
  coord_flip()

# 
beta_spread <- emu_theses_topics |> 
  mutate(topic = paste0("topic", topic)) |> 
  spread(topic, beta) |> 
  filter(topic1 > 0.001, topic2 > .001) |> 
  mutate(log_ratio = log2(topic2/topic1))

beta_spread

beta_spread %>%
  group_by(direction = log_ratio > 0) %>%
  slice_max(abs(log_ratio), n = 20) %>% 
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(term = reorder(term, log_ratio)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(log_ratio, term)) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(x = "Log2 ratio of beta in topic 2 / topic 1", y = NULL)

emu_theses_documents <- tidy(emu_theses_lda, matrix = "gamma")
emu_theses_documents

emu_theses_documents |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(str_sub(document, 1, 50), gamma), y = gamma, fill = topic)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") + 
  coord_flip()

emu_theses_documents |> 
  inner_join(emu_theses |> select(title, graduation_year), by = c("document" = "title")) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(str_sub(document, 1, 50), gamma), y = gamma, fill = topic)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") + 
  coord_flip() + 
  facet_wrap(~ graduation_year, ncol = 1, scales = "free", drop = TRUE)

emu_theses_documents |> 
  inner_join(emu_theses |> select(title, graduation_year), by = c("document" = "title")) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = factor(graduation_year), y = topic, fill = factor(topic))) +
  geom_col()
```

The `tf-idf` statistic shows high values for the names of thesis locations that tend to be high-frequency thesis-specific words. As such, it shows words that are the most important to one document in a collection of documents [@silge2017].
