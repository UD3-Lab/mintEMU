The legacy scripts included in this folder were used for the preparation of the
research compendium, as follows:

- `create-rrtools.R` was used to create and update the research compendium
with functions from the `rrtools` package;
- `testing-workflow.R` documents steps used in documenting the functions
created for the research compendium;
- `1-prepare-metadata.R`, `2-prepare-for-publication.R`, and 
`3-package-data-workflow.R` were run in sequence for the preparation of the 
data included in the package.
