1,2009,Fall,'Territories in between': A comparative permeability study of two European regions between urban and rural - local and global,'Territories in between',A comparative permeability study of two European regions between urban and rural - local and global,Austria + Netherlands,52.3544331,4.9995131,"The in between city is often used to name areas which are neither urban nor rural, where “the sharp distinction between city and landscape has dissolved into an ecological and cultural continuum of a built structure between city and landscape”. Sieverts in (Huhlmann, 2007). The Thesis aims to gain a better understanding of how these territories function and how they perform according to social, economic and ecological planning goals, by developing an approach using the concept of ‘Permeability’, which I define as the property and capacity of the territory that facilitates connections and therefore flows. As a first step a classification on the regional scale to identify the ‘Territories in Between’ using two deliberately distinct and different case study areas (the province of South Holland in the Netherlands and the state of The Tyrol in Austria), is undertaken to later be able to draw conclusions which are valid in the European context. An integrated approach using the concept of permeability based on the understanding of these territories as both a place (a site or territory) and as a number of often just loosely bounded, relatively disconnected and dispersed, perhaps sprawling activities, made in and through many different kinds of networks, is used to gain a better understanding of the ‘Territories in Between’ in the two test case areas. Through the combination of economic, social and ecological as well as mapable permeability indicators, the territories can be investigated in a moderate relationalism which allows overcoming the ‘network versus territories’ as well as the ‘human versus nature’ divide. “On the one hand, networks should not be seen as non-spatial and without ‘geographical anchors’ and on the other hand, territories and scales should not be viewed as closed and static.” (Jones, 2009) Following this idea the indicators are chosen according to their suitability to establish a relationship between the territory and the flows within the landscape, describing the traces of these flows. Finally general planning and design principles are developed, which are based on a relational and not functional understanding of the ‘Territories in Between’, by comparing the indicators and the results within the different case study areas."
2,2014,Spring,(Re-)designing the planning process: The case study of Panepistimiou Street in Athens,(Re-)designing the planning process,The case study of Panepistimiou Street in Athens,"Athens, Greece",37.9755648,23.7348324,"This diploma thesis explores the Greek planning tradition and practice and its capacity to address the real urgencies of the urban environment and deliver long-term benefits to society and the economy. An overview of recent regeneration proposals is presented in order to investigate the reasons why planning in Greece is said to have weak influence. The evidence presented is essentially reinforced by the extensive study of an on-going regeneration project that takes place in the city centre of Athens: the case study of Panepistimiou Street. The so-called “university” street-one of the major traffic axes of Athens- is currently planned to be transformed into a large pedestrian avenue with public transportation flows. The case study is evaluated in order to understand the “how” and the “what” of the urban proposal: What is the vision that is leading the project of urban transformation and what are the tools that are used to implement the project? Finally, what effect do these interventions have on the urban environment of the city centre? Following this research, the thesis focuses on the construction of alternative ways to intervene in the city through the tool of strategic spatial planning. The aim is to explore the tool, its definition, origin and main principles, and introduce four values that guide the proposal for the area. These are the qualities of a visionary, relational, integrative and action-oriented plan. In such a framework, Panepistimiou becomes the testbed for a coherent and coordinated process of urban regeneration. A new vision for the area is suggested but also a set of actors, processes and institutional provisions is employed. The thesis concludes with a reflection and evaluation of the proposed process. How is it different from the existing project approach and what broader transformation is suggested for the way 21st century urbanists plan and intervene to the city? In the context of the Greek planning system, what institutional provisions are needed to be added for strategic interventions to take place in the future?"

Famagusta, a city on the eastern coast of Cyprus, is used as a demonstration site for exploring ‘urban peacebuilding’ strategies seen through the lens of spatial practices. The Turkish invasion of 1974 resulted in the territorial division and occupation of 37% of the Island’s territory, while its two main communities, the Greek and the Turkish Cypriots, have remained alienated ever since. The partition and the presence of a violent buffer zone a ‘no man’s land’ along the islands’ east west axis, is the driving force behind a country of two systems and two cultures. Partition was to affect most dramatically the political geography of future development in Famagusta. On August 14th 1974, the whole of Famagusta was occupied by the Turkish army and Varosha, its southern suburb, was sealed off as a no-go area under the control of the Turkish Forces undermining the growth and development of the city. From April 2015, a new momentum in politics has given hope to the people of Cyprus for reunification, with Famagusta on the forefront of the negotiations. The research builds upon the potential of a ‘shared Famagusta’ to offer strategic motivations for a ‘shared future’ and a prototype of peaceful coexistence in a reunified Cyprus. How peace can be materialized in the urban environment and how the city could be transformed into an arena where common imaginaries and shared urban narratives are negotiated and developed between warring communities is explored. This work draws attention to the complex connection between space, identity and politics and although addresses the specific context of the Cyprus case, it provides insights to a much wider discussion of academic and societal relevance."
4,2018,Spring,"A Benevolent Future: Towards a strategic spatial framework fostering social resilience - The case of Dharavi, Mumbai",A Benevolent Future,"Towards a strategic spatial framework fostering social resilience - The case of Dharavi, Mumbai","Dharavi, Mumbai",19.044463,72.8586177,"The thesis explores the social potential of space i.e. the social logic of space to enhance resilience of society. As social resilience is defined as the capacity of society to cope, adapt or transform societal relations towards external stress, space that is a ‘construction’ and a function of the structure of society hosts the ability in fostering societal robustness against external perturbations (Alan H. Kwok, 2016; Raffestein 2012; Hillier,1984). <br/>World Global Risks report 2018 considers extreme weather events and natural hazards as a major disturbance towards risk perception (WEF, 2018). At present, Mumbai as well as other cities are at risk from natural and man-made hazards (floods, fires, ethnic violence etc.). Although, Mumbai did witness acts of benevolence by its people during the times of crisis such as the floods, the past and present situation of Mumbai’s spatial and social fragmentation underlines threats towards external stresses. Besides this, the geographical isolation of Mumbai, a man-made archipelago with a population of over 22 million (Review, 2018) makes the accessibility to resources that could maintain and foster resilience even more difficult. Hence, the reliance on social solidarity as a means towards fostering social resilience is a key to safeguarding the future of Mumbai and its people. Although, resilience is not a final state but a process, it is the system’s ability to maintain its integrity and to return to its original state, a state of equilibrium, normality, when it is confronted with a disruption or hazard” (Holling,1973). <br/>Through the case of Dharavi - Mumbai, a historic, unplanned settlement located in the heart of Mumbai that faces challenges and highlights potentials in the formation and maintenance of social solidarity, the thesis aims at developing a strategic spatial framework towards fostering social resilience under the purview of the ‘social logic of space’. It explores the spatial capacity in time to enhance social solidarity against external stresses (man-made and natural).<br"

Post-socialist countries went through the period of transitioning to free-market and democracy, and this process resulted in hybrid institutional, social, and urban forms. As the global pressures intensify, countries need to employ development mechanisms that will ensure a more sustainable future and slow down the process of global warming. Transitioning to sustainability planning is becoming more urgent, as scientists warn that scenarios for the future in which the business-as-usual approach is carried out bring disastrous consequences to our environment. Many post-socialist countries, such as Serbia, are caught in a path-dependency ideology, trying to position themselves in a global economic network, thus ignoring the social and environmental issues. Current development in Belgrade is shaped by market-driven mega projects that are a result of public-private partnerships. There is also a lack of participation in the planning process, which is institutionally allowed. This leads to the development of the most attractive locations which are predominantly located at the riverfront. This kind of ad hoc development does not follow a comprehensive strategy and leads to fatal consequences such as – loss of biodiversity, social stratification, endangered heritage, loss of sense of place and ultimately: unsustainable development of the riverfront. This thesis provides an overview of the consequences that led to the present state that the country is in regarding urban planning and development. The goal is to examine the implications for transitioning to sustainable urban development, starting from the actual conditions of the Belgrade riverfront territory and the planning procedure in place. Urban planning is a political process that has certain values embedded in it. Instead of adapting the values to the existing procedure, the values should shape the process. The current government has a strong agenda which many citizens protest against and this is why the proposed framework for transition is meant to serve as a starting point for moving towards a comprehensive sustainable planning and development process that would provide real results in the actual state of the riverfront. The framework that is proposed is an altered urban planning process that approaches the riverfront territory holistically, through different scales. This has to be done through a participatory process in which the acceptance of limits, protection of existing qualities and regeneration play an important role. These guiding principles are applied to environmental, social and economic dimension to provide a comprehensive urban planning approach for the sustainable riverfront."

Thus, inscribed in a path dependence of unfulfilled promises of local development, the Amazon Waterway Project seeks to create an international trade chain connecting produce from Manaus in Brazil to China by dredging the four most important Peruvian Amazonian rivers. In such a complex territory, the execution of the Amazon Waterway Project represents both a risk of widening the territorial unevenness gap and a challenge for creating alternative development. In this regard, the research shows the relevance of spatial planning and design looking upon the talents, opportunities and knowledge of the territory to create new shared understandings for a holistic development. This would pursue social and ecological wellbeing by involving local and global agents, as well as reframing big scale infrastructure projects as integral development opportunities. The main goal is to build a cooperative relationship of Amazonian cities and communities. Therefore, a landscape economy strategy is envisioned at multiple scales as a start for a co-creation process. This includes a series of interventions, guides, protocols and dialogue spaces towards the construction of a New Amazon Pact."

With the city’s growing popularity its urban population is expected to double in coming 20 years; while the area governed by Pune planning authorities will double in next five years. The current planning approach is based on differentiated land use which focuses on territorial scales and long term goals. In this planning approach, everyday life processes tend to be ignored. This causes problems which are most prominent in the urban fringes. Fringe areas are vital in the growth and prosperity of the region as a whole. For its weak institutional situation the fringe lands urbanize in an unpremeditated manner and the potentials of its diverse environments degrade by the time the area begins to develop fully. We address this issue with a focus on complexity theories of cities (CTC). Herein, the city is viewed as a complex system characterized by the interaction of dynamics from the bottom-up and top-down forces. With this insight the proposed complexity approach explores into local dynamics and investigates how they can be taken into account to include contextual qualities. This is done by using micro-stories that describe the day-to-day life of families, including previous generations and their socio-spatial context. This information helps interpret the territory in a manner so as to build plausible visions. From this approach we attempt to outline - how a weak institutional environment in the current planning system may be strengthened towards a more inclusive process of urbanization."

This has brought environmental issues mostly related with water, but also problems related with the whole living environment on the territory of the mountains. So far problems of the city have been addressed either as valley or as mountain, not as a single system. The thesis takes one river and its drainage basin as case study that can be replicated in the rest of rivers of the city. The focus of study addresses the ecological regeneration of the drainage basin as starting point for regenerating the living conditions and joint that articulates the territory of the mountain with the valley. The geomorphological characteristics of the drainage basin are taken as backbone to define a spatial strategy that can be replicated and shift the city towards a more balanced metropolis."

This urban divide is described here as the result of a dense historic stratification of unfinished urban projects, in terms of current socio-economic processes, and as related to the conflict between the structure of the city and its wider environment. Rather than targeting the less developed half of the city, the proposed strategy addresses the area of interaction between the two sides: the valley. Born from the former floodplain of Dâmbovi?a, the river crossing Bucharest's very center, here the valley is structurally defined on the West-East direction, while the three case studies show the details of the intervention meant to improve the integration between North and South. The work is concluded with a reflection on the possible wider effects of the intervention and initiates a debate on how the structure of the city might change into a configuration that has a more synergistic relation with the territory."

Its accelerated development in two stages (1850s- 1930s and 1950s-1989) generated a superposition of fragmented urban projects (signs of various stages of modernity) that were never finished. These stages in its evolution were generated by advances in technology and therefore the reformulation of the infrastructural framework, and changes in the perception of open-spaces as main arenas of publicness. After 1989, the inability of the City to produce a new infrastructural paradigm and its careless treatment of the open-space through market speculation produced chaotic development, extreme fragmentation, lack of public space, and last but most important, the lack of public trust in planners. With this problem setting in mind there are a few questions that become the backbone of this thesis: How could we use infrastructure and open-space to describe the future of Bucharest? Can they act as frameworks to produce a new paradigm for the city? Can Bucharest become a testing ground for conjectures that become relevant at a wider scale? These are the main questions to which this thesis research should be able to answer. By developing conjectures illustrating how Bucharest could be shaped around infrastructure and open-space, the ambition of this work is to produce guidelines and tools for an isotropic and permeable Bucharest."

The dispersed and fragmented landscapes of expansion are analyzed to understand which are the elements of conflict and discussion in order to define new possible futures for the region. The main objective of the thesis is to understand how the fragmented in?between metropolitan landscapes have been created, to analyse the patterns of occupation and transformation and to investigate the potentials they have to be constructed in the future in a much more integrated and sustainable way. The methodology of the regional analysis carried out goes through the historical evolution of the region focusing on the processes of urbanization, industrialization and development of infrastructures. The study shows how along the defined stages, the relation between city and nature has evolved until the present situation where its boundaries are fragmented and blurred. The analysis of the different patterns of growth and its extrapolation allows to develop different possible models of growth. A closer up in the Vallès Plain area allows the definition of specific strategies aligned with the regional developed scenario. In order to shift from large scale diagrams and scenarios to a closer approach on reality, an area is designed as a test of its spatial quality."

The irregular political structure was supported by an increasingly powerful new economy which generated growth promoted by two opposite extremes. From above, the city was promoted by the public and private sector under the influence of ideological models claiming to have a sole and absolute response to the rapid urban development of the twentieth century. Real estate developments adopted the suburban “garden city” model for the elites, while state policies gave a touch of post-war modernity to this model, on the grounds of “social utopia”. The set of one-way urban policies instigated alternative responses by those who were excluded from the system, giving a final shape to urban needs in a spontaneous model of growth (also called informal) promoted from the bottom. This parallel growth never reached an effective dialogue and growth models became patterns of exclusion. As a result, the contemporary profile of Caracas lies on a fragmented urban structure, physically inaccessible, setting a segregated social configuration. This work proposes a strategy that promotes urban renewal from both directions. The “top-down” strategy seeks to respond to population growth through a proposal for densification of the existing city. In contrast to the model of territorial expansion of “Socialist Cities” promoted by the state, the strategy aims to increase urban density on top of the existing low densities caused by the suburban model, taking advantage of the existing transport infrastructure. In parallel, the “bottom-up” strategy pays attention to the specific location, giving importance to topics such as place identity, place diversity and place governance. The starting point is the “project of one street” with immediate impact on the local scale. However, the project responds to conditions that are common in different parts of the city giving rise to similar strategies that can be repeated to generate a combined impact with metropolitan relevance."

Flevopolders in the IJsselmeer delta area is chosen as the site of study due to its unique natural and cultural settings, which represents a hard technology-based living environment that is dealing with its environmental vulnerability, the metropolitan pressure and the climate change uncertainty. The application of landscape infrastructure is based on the concept of integrating natural and human habitats through biophysical forces to form an operative landscape structure. It is implemented through-scale under the guidance of two fundamental design principles, ground level adjustment and water level management. The overall operative structure consists of the prepared ground of the territory and a robust ecological backbone. It helps the territory to pick up the lost natural dynamics and habitat diversity, as well as to guide the cultural development in an ecological-based, multifunctional and adaptive way. The notion of landscape infrastructure and its application transform the original landscapes in Flevopolders into an interwoven landscape that contains diverse and flexible interconnected spaces. It becomes the new framework that guides the future development of the territory, and reveals the optimal characteristics of a delta area."

During the past century, urban expansions took place without any special regard towards existing cultural heritage expressions. Despite the significant role of heritage in shaping societal cultural identities and the extensive space that occupies within the built space, it is not taken into consideration in strategic planning. As a result, a great amount of cultural heritage remains unrecognized and ignored. Meanwhile, the urban transformations have been immense and largely unsustainable, in ways that consumed the natural environment and endangered the future development of the city. The aim of this research and design project was to highlight the latent potential of cultural heritage as a driver of urban redevelopments focused on sustainability. To explore this argument, the project took as case study the periphery of Piraeus in Athens metropolitan area, Greece and examined the relevant concepts and proposals at the metropolitan and local scale. The process of research, analysis and design was a continuous dialogue between two basic lines of narrative, namely the cultural heritage and the sustainable urban development. The research and design process employed various methods, according to the needs and challenges of each topic. The findings led to the elaboration of a strategy for the periphery of Piraeus comprising guiding principles, design solutions at the local scale and governance arrangements. The final structural and design proposals included: i) the recommendation of a new definition and a two-level system of official designation of cultural heritage elements; ii) a set of guiding principles for sustainable urban development at the metropolitan scale; iii) a design solution for Apollon neighbourhood, which acted as a showcase of the principles’ applicability; iv) the development of a national inventory and the implementation of pilot projects, as counteraction to the governance challenges."

However, economic development, demographic growth and urban expansion have overpowered the more natural domain creating non–dynamic flows within the system, compressing all functions at the city scale, specially in Chiclayo as the capital of the region. Furthermore, due to climate change, natural disasters are getting more acute leaving behind devastated productive land, infrastructure and small rural towns, affecting mostly vulnerable population. Given that almost half of the region is cover by un–built areas with mixed ecological value, this broader –currently disconnected– landscape holds great opportunity as a linking element with the urban tissue, putting forwards the idea for creating symbiotic relations through green and blue multifunctional infrastructure and, at the same time reinforcing the regional identity. From the aforementioned context, the urgency for an integrative planning comprising urban, rural and natural landscapes arise. Due to the importance of agriculture not just in the economic dimension, but in the regional idiosyncrasy, productive lots hold the capacity to be integrated into the proposed green and blue initiative re–drawing the inherent connection between wilderness and, man–made landscapes focusing in gathering spaces, which are mainly non–existent within city boundaries. Furthermore, the territorial understanding is comprised by three natures, the first one refers to wilderness landscapes, the second one to man–made landscapes and the third one to ‘highly designed’ landscapes, where the third nature is understood as a complex intertwining of ecological elements, communities, cultural services and flows through processes of space &amp; time."

The city's structural plan (POT) is under review, trying to adapt to the local and global challenges: mass migration; social integration of communities in a post-conflict transition; an economic shift from a commercial dependency of the border into a self-productive region; the demand for housing and the occupation of high-risk areas, are some of the main aspects. These issues are more evident in the fringe areas of the city (edges), where informality is the main pattern of urban growth, with a later upgrade by the local government.<br/>Then, how to achieve an inclusive urban development in the edges of a border city with rapid social and economic transformations?<br/>This graduation project explores the process of urbanization in the edges of Cucuta and the implications of the border in the city's growth. The intention is to question the disparity between spatial planning and the spontaneous consolidation of the city's peripheries. In particular, this research focuses on one of these edges called 'El Rodeo', where more than 5,000 families have settled illegally during the last 20 years. Currently, there is a community development project for this area that involves multiple stakeholders, including the mayor's office. However, there is not a spatial strategy that envisions El Rodeo in the coming years.<br/>Hopefully, the outcome of this work can be used as feedback for the planning office and inspire interventions in similar contexts.<br"

Its population went from 600 thousand people in 1940 to nearly 9.5 million people nowadays. Former agriculture fields between the coast and the beginning of the Andes mountains were quickly filled with urban developments. Neither the public sector nor the private housing market provided decent living conditions in the city for all these newcomers. 34% of the city’s land was developed informally (Municipality of Lima, 2013a) and 70% of the houses were to some degree self-built. The process of urban development and, specifically, the control of the space through land ownership, generated a segregated city. The urban poor usually accessed low-cost land or housing in areas exposed to high levels of risk, with accessibility problems or lack of basic infrastructure.<br/><br/>The current process of urban development, along with a quantitative understanding of housing in policy, continues reproducing socio-spatial segregation today. Buying a plot to land traffickers on the steep slopes of the periphery is the primary way for the low-income population to access a place to live in the city.<br/><br/>This graduation project has two main goals. On the one hand, it tries to understand the relations between housing, urban development and socio-spatial segregation in Lima. On the other, it explores the potential of housing (understood as a process) to develop alternative models of urban development and reduce socio-spatial segregation, in search of a more just city."

This correlation has also led many to refer to this phenomenon as the ‘paradox of plenty’. When a country depends exclusively on the extraction of non-renewable resources it faces a wide range of risks that can be extremely difficult to manage, since they are created by powerful external factors. And Venezuela, a nation that has mainly depended on oil and mineral extraction since the 1920s, has not been the exception. The astronomical rise in the prices of various metals over the past two decades has put great pressures on resource-rich countries all over the world, especially in the global south. In recent years, and pushed by the drop of oil prices, the Venezuelan government decided to shift its attention from the oil fields of the country to the tropical forests of the Venezuelan Guayana, where large deposits of iron, bauxite, gold, diamonds, coltan, and many other rare minerals can be found.<br/><br/>But the ongoing economic crisis and the subsequent lack of opportunities throughout the country, have also promoted the escalation of illegal small-scale gold mining operations in this part of the Amazonia. Thousands of people, especially in neglected and peripheral areas, have found a way to survive the crisis by working in the gold mines. However, this dependency on resource extraction is having far-reaching consequences that will be felt by many generations to come, from an environmental, social and economic point of view. And from a larger perspective, the idea of maintaining a model based on the exploitation of non-renewable resources hinders the possibility of a sustainable future for the region. But is there a way out of the resource curse? What kind of<br/>regional and local development should be promoted to overcome this dependency, and for whom? These are difficult questions that nevertheless must be addressed, especially in the Amazonian context. Therefore, this work seeks to explore the spatial dimension of this problem in the Venezuelan Guayana, to understand if the restructuring of the territory can create the conditions for the generation of alternative economies from the bottom-up and reduce the current dependence of the region on resource extraction."

This conversation typically focuses on the spatial adaptability of shorelines, dense urban environments, and the enhancement of green spaces. While these measures are undoubtedly important to implement, there is a lack of public awareness regarding how our region’s food systems and the agricultural landscapes that sit on edge of cities across Canada, must also adapt. <br/>Agriculture is a key part of the Canadian economy, both in the export of products grown domestically and the importation of products from the United States, Mexico, and Asia. This reliance on imported food is a standard part of the food supply chain in Canada. However, with a changing climate affecting places like California (where a lot of fresh produce is imported from) and global challenges such as the COVID-19 pandemic, these supply chains are becoming more vulnerable to unexpected disruptions. This, in turn, threatens the food security of all Canadians. This thesis explores the adaptive potential of the local and regional food system in Canada’s only urbanized delta region, the Lower Mainland of British Columbia. As with all delta regions around the world, this low-lying metropolitan region will increasingly face many challenges related to flooding, ongoing urbanization, and the unpredictability of extreme natural disasters that threaten communities and food production. The Lower Mainland is one of the most agriculturally dynamic regions in Canada and is unique as a considerable amount of arable and cultivated land is integrated closely with the urban fabric of the territory. However, with decreasing self-reliance in regional food production and an over-reliance on cheap imported products, the Lower Mainland is at a crossroads when it comes to the future of its food system. The intent of the design proposal is to find ways in which to rebalance regional food cultivation by expanding how and where production takes place. Integrating agriculture tightly within communities and using it as a catalyst for new public spaces, urban development, and agri-tech innovation along a key regional corridor will serve as the basis for the design exploration. <br/>The objective of this thesis is therefore to demonstrate how the spatial and functional organization our food systems can, and must, adapt given the uncertainty of our collective future. Vulnerable supply chains, unexpected disasters and shifts in the global economy significantly risk our ability to adequately feed people. If we take this issue seriously and begin planning for an uncertain future by first addressing what makes us most vulnerable, we can begin to adapt and build the capacity to face these challenges with confidence. <br"

In part of facilitate the development, the national government has actively adopted the form of apartment under supportive national policies and planning instruments. The mass production in large quantities of apartment complexes has rested on the conviction that it would be an effective device to deal with ultra-dense environment in Seoul where the skyrocketing population growth has challenged the demand of adequate living space (Kim, 2018).<br/>It is true that densification is one of the core in contemporary society, giving essence in urbanity. It has been always the intriguing topic in urbanism which dominates and imposes the prevailing theories and manifests at that ages. Yet, what constituted the density in apartment complexes in Seoul is the logic of capitalism, where the quantity of floor area of verticality decides everything in speculating the gainable maximum profits. Importantly, the challenges inherent in apartment lie at its scale of complex (block), not at the building itself, as Grands Ensemble, where the characteristics of enlargement and internalization execute the exclusivity and polarization between spaces. While the more than half of Seoul’s citizens are living in apartments, the ongoing phenomenon of producing apartment complex would continue to proliferate, as the desire to live in luxurious and enclosed community will not disappear. <br/>This graduation project aims to explore the new role of apartment complexes in relation to urban fabric, and to open the discussion for envisioning integrated and dynamic living environment. Therefore, it seeks the new definition of ‘Apartment Urbanism’ in Seoul, where the density is represented not only by form, but also by its function and overarching relationships that operate simultaneously. Borrowing the lens of ‘depth structure’, the orienting concept in implementing design strategies as territorial, scalable and institutional depths, this project argues that the despite the rationale in area-based approach characterized by rigid zoning system, the relation-based approach using patterns delivers the possibility to embrace all interacting and conflicting forces as a cohesive language. Conditioned at different settings of private and public properties, it proposes a model that is more adjustable to the context and adaptive to process, ultimately shaping the synergetic relationship between spaces and people."

In the cities next to the Medway River estuary, the capacity to adapt to flood risks had been weakened by urban development and intense industrial usage. This degrading led to the loss of flood buffers and the recreational value of the coastal landscape. Moreover, climate change threatens large areas of nationally important habitats in the estuary. Coastal habitats are likely to be submerged by the rising sea. The rise in sea level can also accelerate the natural erosion of coastal cliffs. To address these problems, a more resilient landscape approach is needed to increase the coastal resilience. Therefore, this design-related research regarded resilience as the theoretical backbone, embraced landscape-based design approaches, including layer approach, scenario study, and mapping as research strategies. The project developed and applied design strategies in three lower-scale sites. First, the site on the Isle of Sheppey focused on coastline protection. A nature-based offshore island structure is proposed to diminish the surf, create space for tidal habitats, and provide recreational use. Next, on the Rainham coastline, to respond to intertidal habitat loss, managed realignment and growing marshes are the key strategies to restore the dynamics of the ecosystem. Last, the study proposed a transformation scheme for the Medway city estate site to relocate flood defence, provide space for tidal rivers, and accommodate mixed-use development. Each proposal could grow with time, increase ecological benefits, and create multifunctional programs. In the end, the study framed a vision on regional development, aiming to increase the socio-ecological resilience of the Medway river landscape."

The method is based on the tools of scenario construction, transect analysis and urban section, and is tested in the Rotterdam The Hague Metropolitan Region (MRDH). The goal of the method is to enable the urbanist to participate as a forerunner in the interdisciplinary discussion on the development of this novel technology.<br/><br/>Despite the potentially important positive and negative effects of automated vehicles on mobility and human life in general, their spatial represent a research gap which must be addressed by urbanism. In order to do so, the profession must have a specific aim and method. The identified aim is urban liveability, which is defined in the project as a combination of three criteria, performance and impact of mobility, natural and built environment, and society and economy, both in regional and local scales. In building a method to work with AV, the project resorts to two specific instruments of urbanism: foresight (scenario) and through-sight (transect and section). The method was designed in the following way: first, two main driving forces of spatial change were extracted from the available literature on AV, density and separation of flows. Secondly, the territory of the MRDH was analysed through the prism of these drivers using the transect method. The transect was applied to the most intense metropolitan axis between the two urban cores Rotterdam and The Hague. On this axis, data regarding urban subzones, network accessibility and liveability data were superimposed to understand the connections between urban fabric, mobility and liveability on which the scenarios would be built. Further, three critical points in different settings were chosen for case studies: an urban centre, a residential area and an urban edge with motorway links. <br/>The main step of the method is scenario construction. Using the driving forces of density and separation of flows, and based on hypotheses available in literature regarding AV and the evolution of the region, four extreme scenarios were described: Clockwork Utopia, characterised by concentrated urbanity and AV separated from other flows; Shared Patchwork, characterised by concentrated urbanity and AV leading to merger of flows; Efficient Garden Region, characterised by dispersed urbanisation and separated flows; and Infinite Randstad, characterised by dispersed urbanisation and merged traffic flows. The scenarios were inspired by various theoretical models, visionary and realised projects. In the second stage of scenario construction, Clockwork Utopia (S1) and Infinite Randstad (S4) were further developed. For both scenarios, regional models of networks and urban fields were designed, and the three case study locations were analysed using the urban section. For each of the case studies a package of briefs, for urbanism, architecture and society, were proposed based on the liveability analysis, and the specific context of the scenario. The solutions in the section have a research-by-design character, used to test the reciprocal resistances of the urban space and the AV technology which need to be overcome.<br/><br/>Finally, the scenarios were evaluated using the liveability criteria and future directions of research, design and policy were proposed. Overall, S1 could be described as an extreme evolution of current trends, where AV has a propelling role, while S4 is a radical change, with AV as trigger, creating new urban occupation patterns and lifestyles. Further attention needs to be accorded to the research of AV safely sharing the urban ground with pedestrians and cyclist, impacts on urban sprawl, connected energy systems and territorial coverage, to design spaces for socio-economic encounter and new architectural programs incorporating AV, as well as to policies regarding traffic management, active mobility and tackling economic disruptions.<br/><br/>This thesis aimed not necessarily to give answers to all of these questions, but to open windows for the urbanist to imagine the future of the relationship between city and AV technology starting from liveability. A future not for a driverless, but a self-driven city."

With the cholera outbreak of 1874 the criticalities of centuries of uncontrolled urban development under foreign kings rose to the fore of the public opinion of the Kingdom of Italy. Yet, for the following decades until nowadays, institutions and politicians failed in providing an integrated vision for the city that could give it a new inclusive identity. Instead, lack of dialogue, path dependency among stakeholders and scarce involvement of communities served the interests of a weak entrepreneurial class and extremized the social problems of the old capital.<br/> King Ferdinando II and Francesco II of Bourbon, the last royals of Naples, saw in the geographical position of the South of Italy the protection of their power: as they liked to say, the peninsula was confining with the salty water of the Mediterranean Sea toward south and the Holy water of the Vatican state up north (Astarita, 2006). This image not only reflected the attitude of the monarchs in international affairs, but it also reveals the two major constraints that have hampered the Neapolitan urban development: a problematic relationship with the sea and the unwillingness to open to a diverse liberal society. <br/>What had grown in between these two limits, was what Walter Benjamin and Asja Lacis would have referred to as the Porous city (Benjamin, Lacis, 1925). When the two visited Naples in 1925 found an obstinately antimodern city where the people had the same consistence of the stone that constituted its walls and that, in its rejection of dichotomies, was a distant alternative to the rational northern European cities which the authors were so used to. According to their description, the urban environment of the Parthenopean city was extremely promiscuous: families from different social extractions used to share the same ancient buildings and attend the same squares, where a crowded market poured into the street in a continuous swarm of praises and trades, that could only be broken open by the sudden passage of a religious procession. <br/>Since then, this image lived a life of its own, having a profound impact on the imaginary of urbanists and planners across the world and reoccurring in different forms in the speeches and texts of researchers over the last seventy years. Most notably, the Italian duo Bernardo Secchi and Paola Viganò reinterpreted this concept in their work for the city of Antwerp in 2009 (Secchi, Viganò, 2009). The two urbanists, in fact, would later explain how the theme of porosity does not only concern the material quality of the buildings but rather more the different ways through which different city users appropriate the space. As such, porosity allows for diversity in the urban environment maximizing social and economic interaction (Tallen, 2008), thus enabling kinship network, the system of formal and informal relationships that make up a community to be active and thriving.<br/>But what is left of the porosity of Naples? Since the end of the XIX century, having by then lost the role of capital, the city had to go under a much-needed process of reinvention and even if originally Naples had to be a maritime city, the foreign rulers, especially during the two centuries before the Italian unification, never developed the full potentiality of the port (Di Mauro, 2006). Under the new regime instead, the Neapolitan elite class rediscovered the sea in its potential for the industrial development. Following logic of economic efficiency and rationality led to new patterns of expansion and consumption of land (Ascher, 2001) and the insalubrious territories, once considered the limit to urban expansion, became the desirable location for the new Industrial city. The old walls of the city where gradually demolished and the city began its expansion towards east in the Borgo Loreto, the marshy delta of the Sebeto river and the, at the time separate, town of San Giovanni a Teduccio. These Bad lands (Secchi, 2006) were necessary for the current socio-economical functioning of the city, not only, because they hosted the construction of warehouses and fabrics, but especially, because they accommodated the rural immigrants that would have constituted the human capital of the new economy. For many, these transitional cities have been constituting the access to the urban social network and economy and they retained this function even when the deindustrialization took over the initial motivation of their existence. The lack of access to facilities, poor housing conditions, low property value and population decline transformed these lands into enclaves for the low-income classes and those who are excluded by the society (Grahame Shane, 2005). Conversely, the Neapolitan upper and middle classes steadily fled the historical centre to pursue a new lifestyle on the hills up west and restructured the city to serve their interests. Nowadays Naples has partially lost its porosity and presents many visible and invisible barriers, whether are they segregating infrastructures, low quality urban and housing environment, monofunctional districts, differences in the social status and political representation. <br/>Since the 70s attempt to convert the city’s economy to the tertiary sector, Naples’ development has been driven by the alleged will of answering to the many crises of the city without ultimately being successful (Galasso, 1987). This is, in some measure, due to the fact that the city’s institutions are still partially tied to their conception of the “Holy water” that manifests itself in a in a scarce attitude towards change that results in institutional inertia (De Martino, 2020). Emblematic in these regards are the not fulfilled promises of the at the time just elected new mayor of the city Luigi de Magistris toward the Islamic community in Eastern Naples. This rapidly growing community had been promised in 2011 the construction of the first Mosque of city and an Islamic cemetery. Only after 10 years, at the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic, in August 2020, the municipality granted the concession for the use of a land to bury the dead (il Mattino, 2020). <br/>The genealogy of the Eastern Naples returns the image of a bad land that has never been given the proper tools for development and whose communities have never been involved in the decision making. Nowadays as then, it is a Purgatory, a city of perennial transition, of goods and people: the established Neapolitan population that aspires to move to other parts of the city or the immigrants arriving from overseas.<br/>In this work, I explore how can the study of the porosity of the urban environment set the bases for a community-based design approach. After having delved into the study of the context of the East Coast of Naples, I focus on the Case Nuove and Mercato del Ferro areas, the first districts to be built outside the former walls of the city in the old Borgo Loreto, and their relationship with the Mercato, the historical neighbourhood grown behind the city walls. The two are institutionally one administrative entity and share an increasing lack of porosity that manifests itself in visible and invisible barriers, problematic social issues, and low quality of the urban environment. Taking this case as example, I will define a design process and stakeholders engagement strategy through which to answer the question: Through what means can Eastern Naples provide a spatially just alternative for its citizens?<br/><br"

Taking one of the most illustrative river basin, Dajia River, the steepest river with the most water resource, as the study case, the project intends to test the hypothesis of perceiving mountainous river as opportunities for transforming the river valley as water-sensitive landscape infrastructures. Based on the theories of landscape urbanism, especially the discourses of landscape infrastructure, the project argues that by enhancing water sensitivity in living environment within river scape, the characteristic of landscape can help building a stronger identity for the territory and its inhabitants. Contextualizing the learnings from theories and practices with context analysis, the research integrates principles, strategic tools and spatial potentials at the regional scale, proposing operative landscape structures as the spatial framework for the future development of the river valley. Based on this spatial framework, strategies for transformation are introduced for upstream, midstream and downstream areas according to their respective situations. Then two zoom-in sites, one at the upstream and the other at the downstream areas, are selected to demonstrate possibilities and potentials through design intervention for integrating water infrastructure with spaces of local habitation and activities. To support the proposals with better feasibility, the project phasing and institutional framework will also be proposed, identifying the priority and potential actors in the process. With reflections on the contribution to the fields, suggestion to the current planning system, and evaluation of mutual influences between different sites within the river catchment, the thesis expects to provide a showcase with methodology, strategic tools, and spatial possibilities integrating different cases of interaction between human activities and river environment. More importantly, the project exhibits the spatial potential of a mountainous river landscape as an active role in engaging socioeconomic with nature, as well as guiding the spatial transformation of the territory for the future."

Bridging this gap and achieving a successful transition to a new era. In which theory and practice must work together cohesively creating new methods, models, new points of interest, new forms of professional practice and a new vision. The concept of Open Society is chosen due to the similarities of the situation between today and then (1960s), such as: housing shortage, polarization of discourse and reduction of plurality, increase in social inequality and large global migrations. For this reason, it was decided to study this concept and its projects as the starting point and symbolic break of this long investigation of the modernist project and its attempt to bridge theory and practice. The concept of Open Society appeared in the field of urbanism between the 50-60s, the Welfare State, as an attempt to improve living conditions in the city so that society would prosper. These good intentions did not translate into many success stories and the consequences of these operations continue to cause problems today, as can be seen from the current multiple crises (social, economic, environmental, etc.).<br/>Today there are new approaches to the built environment, which allow or offer us new possibilities to reinterpret the concept of Open Society, something of great importance still in contemporary urban discourse. For this reason, this study proposes to carry out a double investigation on the concept of Open Society (both empirical and conceptual) that will provide knowledge about this concept in two Western European countries. This will help to build a network of knowledge around topics of interest in urban matters. This research aims to investigate and analyze the discursive and projective validity of the concept of Open Society today, the relation between concepts-realities (places), and a critical methodology (open framework) that engages between theory and practice in a continuous dialogue as follows:<br/>-Critically review the concept in the theoretical framework and contemporary global policy frameworks (new urban agenda, theoretical critiques, technical code, etc.).<br/>-Empirically review two case studies that illustrate the implementation of this concept, the phenomena and patterns that have arisen in the friction between the place, the ideals (concept) and the resistance generated by the users.<br/>This research uses a mixed methods approach to examine these two case studies and draw conclusions, and also reflect on the principles and possible unlocking mechanisms. In this way, we generate a discursive break towards a new vision of this concept, which advocates a diverse, inclusive, fair and cohesive ecological societies."

The objective is to develop an approach which integrates the social, economic, and ecological aspects of the landscape.<br/>Through a comprehensive analysis of the landscape of Anuradhapura, the logic of the different systems is identified. Five landscape perspectives are used to structure the research into coherent parts. These different parts detail how the different landscape structures and elements interact in order to form a complex system. The learning is combined in order to form a whole using the concept of space of flows.<br"

This could be achieved by maximising the utilization of natural resources as well as infrastructure develop¬ment. One example is the infrastructure development of Jakarta with its surrounding metro¬politan area (JABODETABEK). Here, we see a rapid development of logistics infrastructure and one of the key project is the utilization of Cikarang-Bekasi-Laut (CBL) canal as inland waterway. Due to its topographical condition and soil type, the surrounding area of CBL has high poten¬tial for agriculture. Moreover, mangrove forest located in the north coastal area protects land from abrasion as well as a home for biodiversity. Those potentials are also contributed by rivers crossing over this territory, including CBL Canal. The transformation of CBL canal from flood¬way system into an inland waterway that connects Jakarta Port and the Cikarang industrial area has a strong prospective to trigger urban sprawl from Jakarta and industrial investment along the canal. At the same time this development threatens the landscape diversity and the identity of today’s territory. This research aims to investigate the possible impact of the transformation of three related systems: urban, production and nature. Two concepts are applied as research method: The Two Networks by Sybrand Tjallingii and Urban Metabolism. The outcome of this research is a structure plan for the regional area of the CBL canal and design principles on the local scale that aim to find possible synergism between urban, production and nature developments."
